THE SKILFUL COOK.</p>



<h2><a name="intro">INTRODUCTION.</a></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> importance of every woman having a thorough
knowledge of domestic economy cannot be too strongly
insisted on. The false refinement which, of late years, has
considered an acquaintance with domestic matters to be
only suitable for servants, has been fraught with the most
disastrous consequences. This may seem strong language,
but it is not too strong. All sanitary reformers know well
enough that it is in the power of many women to prevent
very many deaths, and an incalculable amount of misery
and vice. Speaking of sanitary reform, the late Canon
Kingsley says:&mdash;&lsquo;Women can do in that work what men
cannot. The private correspondence of women, private
conversation, private example of ladies, above all of married
women, of mothers of families, may do what no legislation
can.&rsquo; And again, in the same speech, delivered on behalf
of the Ladies' Sanitary Association, he says:&mdash;&lsquo;Ah! would
to God that some man had the pictorial eloquence to put
before the mothers of England the mass of preventable
agony of mind and body which exists in England, year
after year: and would that some man had the logical
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2">2</a></span>eloquence to make them understand that it is in their
power, in the power of the mothers and wives of the
higher classes&mdash;I will not say to stop it all, God only
knows that&mdash;but to stop, as I believe, three-fourths of it.&rsquo;</p>

<p>This may seem to some, perhaps, too serious an introduction
to a cookery book; but it is my earnest wish that
my book may not be simply a collection of recipes for
cooks to refer to, but a real help to those women who,
recognising the importance of good cookery in sanitary
reform, are doing their utmost (as I know many are) to
acquire that knowledge, and are thereby making the lives
of those about them brighter and happier; and are also by
their examples doing an amount of good that they themselves
scarcely dream of. I have been told more than
once by those benevolently interested in the working
classes that with instruction to ladies on cookery they had
no sympathy, and they seemed to think that it would be
better if lessons on the subject were given exclusively to
the poor. They forget that the wives of the working men
are women who have most of them been domestic servants,
and that what they learn in their situations, and what
habits they there acquire, they take for <i>good</i> or <i>evil</i> into
their own homes; and in this way an ignorant careless
mistress may be doing an infinitude of harm to her sister
women in a lower position than herself. On the other
hand, a mistress who understands thoroughly the management
of a house, by wisely training her servants in habits
of order and industry, by teaching them what they do not
know and have had no opportunity of learning about hygiene
or the laws of health, may be&mdash;in fact cannot help
being&mdash;a blessing indirectly to many homes.</p>

<p>I believe that the working classes must be taught in
this way if they are to be taught at all. I have myself,
over and over again, tried to benefit my poorer sisters by
giving them free lessons on food and cookery; and although
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3">3</a></span>I invariably find a few who are very grateful for such instruction,
the majority, I imagine, never trouble to put in
practice what they have been taught. Their habits have
been already formed, and it is not easy for them to alter
them. But it is a significant fact that those who do value
the lessons are generally respectable hardworking women,
who have held good situations under good mistresses.</p>

<p>I have also heard it very ignorantly objected by some
that by teaching ladies how to cook, you are taking the
bread out of the servants' mouths. This is, indeed, the
conclusion of a shallow mind; for with equal justice and
good sense, it might be said that the owner of any large
business was taking the bread out of his <i>employés'</i>
mouths because he happened to be acquainted with all the
details of his own business, and was able to see that those
in his employment attended to their duties properly. But
this, I suppose, everyone will admit, that the owner of any
business ignorant of the management and details of it,
would not unlikely one day find himself without any business
to manage. And if this is true with regard to men's
businesses, is it not equally so with regard to women's?</p>

<p>I have the greatest sympathy with servants, and would
be the last to injure them in any way. A good servant is
a treasure: and good work always deserves good wages.
But the more a mistress knows of household work herself,
the more is she likely to appreciate a servant who honestly
and conscientiously performs her duties; and by understanding
their difficulties, the more consideration is she
likely to show to those in her employ.</p>

<p>But there are some ladies to whom a knowledge of
domestic economy ought to be especially invaluable&mdash;namely,
those whose means are so limited that they cannot
afford to engage servants who have had any great experience,
and, therefore, who keep only what is called a
general servant, a term which often means a woman or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4">4</a></span>girl who will undertake to do everything, but who has only
the vaguest notions of how anything should be done.
They, poor things, have had no opportunity of learning in
the homes from which they came. But it will be well for
the poor &lsquo;General&rsquo; if her mistress can teach and train
her; for she will then leave her situation with knowledge
and habits that will make her a valuable and useful
woman, and be of the greatest service to her all her life.</p>

<p>It is, however, quite surprising to see the rough way in
which some people allow themselves to be served, and the
muddle in which they prefer to live rather than do anything
themselves that they consider menial; as if an untidy house,
slovenly servants, badly cooked and coarsely served food,
are not likely to do much more to lower their self-respect
than any amount of so-called drudgery. &lsquo;A gentlewoman,&rsquo;
it has been said, &lsquo;never lowers herself by doing that which
would make her feel less a gentlewoman if left undone.&rsquo;</p>

<p>How much healthier and happier, too, many girls would
be, if, instead of going out in all weathers, day after day,
to earn a miserable pittance in any such employment as
daily governesses, they would do some of the lighter housework,
cooking, &amp;c., at home. By being able to do with
one servant instead of two, they would save probably more
than they could earn in other ways, besides being much
stronger from the exercise thus taken. But too many
girls are, unfortunately, imbued with the vulgar notion
that work is not genteel. What a Moloch this gentility
has been and still is! What a number of human sacrifices
are continually placed at its shrine, and what puppets its
votaries become! Mr. Smiles says: &lsquo;There is a dreadful
ambition abroad for being &ldquo;genteel.&rdquo; We keep up appearances
too often at the expense of honesty, and though
we may not be rich, yet we must <i>seem</i> to be so. We must
be &ldquo;respectable,&rdquo; though only in the meanest sense&mdash;in
mere vulgar outward show. We have not the courage to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5">5</a></span>go patiently onward in the condition of life in which it has
pleased God to call us, but must needs live in some fashionable
state to which we ridiculously please to call ourselves;
and all to gratify the vanity of that unsubstantial genteel
world of which we form a part.&rsquo;</p>

<p>It would effect a moral revolution if women would only
look at matters in the true light. How much crime and
misery may be traced to mismanaged unattractive homes!
How many deaths to the ignorance of hygiene! How
much intemperance to the physical depression caused by
badly cooked food! Let us hope that the refinement,
falsely so called, which is only another name for vanity,
laziness, and selfishness, may soon give way to the true
refinement of heart and mind which considers nothing too
menial which will benefit others; nothing too common
that will add to the happiness of our fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>If we women could earnestly and courageously endeavour
to do the duty nearest to us, remembering that all
honest work, of whatever kind, has been for ever ennobled
by the great Founder of our Faith, so should we be, one
in one way and one in another, &lsquo;helping to move (to quote
Dean Goulburn) the wheels of the great world system
whose revolutions are bringing on the kingdom of Christ.&rsquo;
&lsquo;To be good and to be useful,&rsquo; as Canon Kingsley says,
&lsquo;are the two objects for which we were sent into this
world.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Take</span> care that you know definitely what sum you can afford
to spend on your household expenses, and make it a point
of conscience never to exceed it. Market with ready money,
if possible; but, if it is more convenient to pay by the month,
or quarter, never make that an excuse for letting your bills
mount up to double what you can afford to pay. With
accounts, carefully kept, it is quite possible to regulate the
expenditure to the income.</p>

<p>Never order things at random, but inquire the price of
everything before purchasing. Take every pains to know
how to judge of the quality of meat, groceries, &amp;c., so that
you may not be imposed on. Never be ashamed to say you
cannot afford to have this or that. To be poor may be a
misfortune, but it is not a fault; and, indeed, to be rich is
often a far greater misfortune. The discipline of poverty,
and the self-denial it involves, will often strengthen a
character which the luxury of riches would enervate.</p>

<p>Cultivate sufficient independence of character to enable
you to form your household, and regulate your expenses
according to your <i>own</i> means, and not according to the income
of your neighbours. What does it matter if some may
sneer at your thread-bare carpets and frugal fare? The
approval of your own conscience is of far more importance
than the friendship of the vulgar-minded. Above all things
keep your accounts most strictly. Without this you are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7">7</a></span>like a mariner without a compass, or chart, you don't know
where you are or what is your position, and you will find
yourself, before long, on the rocks of debt and difficulty.
Extravagant housekeeping has been the cause of the most
serious evils; and, if persisted in, will be sure, in time, to
wreck the peace and happiness of yourself and family.</p>

<p>Extravagance is, no doubt, often the result of mere
thoughtlessness, but that does not mend matters. There
is as much evil wrought by want of thought as by want of
heart. If it is true that there is but one step between the
sublime and the ridiculous, it is equally true that there is
but one step between folly and wickedness. Therefore, all
young housekeepers ought to give earnest attention to the
management of their affairs, for certainly in these matters
the &lsquo;wise woman buildeth her house, while the foolish
plucketh it down with her hands.&rsquo;</p>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> human body is constantly wearing out. With every
movement, every breath drawn, there is some waste of its
substance. To repair this waste, and, in the case of children,
to provide material for their growth, a certain amount of
food should be taken daily. The food taken should consist
of such qualities as will make flesh and muscle; such as
will also keep up the heat of the body, and give force, or
the power of movement. These foods must contain a certain
quantity of liquid, and the salts necessary to keep the blood
pure.</p>

<p>The foods under the head of flesh-formers, although
classed as flesh-formers, are really compound foods. They
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9">9</a></span>contain some heat-giving as well as flesh-forming properties.</p>

<p>The heat-giving foods, on the contrary, are all simple foods.
Life could not be sustained on any one of them alone, whatever
quantity might be taken. These facts are sufficient to
show the necessity of a mixed diet. Professor Church says
in his lectures on this subject: &lsquo;Our food must be palatable,
that we may eat it with relish, and get the greatest
nourishment from it. The flavour and texture of food, its
taste, in fact, stimulates the production of those secretions&mdash;such
as the saliva and the gastric juice&mdash;by the action of
which the food is digested or dissolved, and becomes finally
a part of the body, or is <i>assimilated</i>. As food, then, must
be relished it is desirable that it should be varied in character&mdash;it
should neither be restricted to vegetable products
on the one hand, nor to animal substances (including milk
and eggs) on the other. By due admixture of these, and
by varying, occasionally, the kind of vegetable or meat taken,
or the modes of cooking adopted, the necessary constituents
of a diet are furnished more cheaply, and at the same time
do more efficiently their proper work. Now, if we were to
confine ourselves to wheaten bread, we should be obliged to
eat in order to obtain our daily supply of albuminoids, or
&lsquo;flesh-formers,&rsquo; nearly 4&nbsp;lb.&mdash;an amount that would give us
nearly twice as much of the starchy matters which should
accompany the albuminoids&mdash;or, in other words, it would
supply not more than the necessary daily allowance of <i>nitrogen</i>,
but almost twice the necessary daily allowance of <i>carbon</i>.
Now animal food is generally richer in albuminoid, or nitrogenous
constituents, than vegetable food; so, by mixing
lean meat with our bread, we may get a food in which the
constituents correspond better to our requirements; for 2&nbsp;lb.
of bread may be substituted by 12&nbsp;oz. of meat, and yet all
the necessary carbon as well as nitrogen be thereby supplied.
As such a substitution is often too expensive, owing to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10">10</a></span>high price of meat&mdash;cheese, which is twice as rich in nitrogenous
matters (that is flesh-formers) as butchers' meat,
may be, and constantly is, employed as a complete diet, and
for persons in health, doing hard bodily work, it affords
suitable nourishment. Even some vegetable products, rich
in nitrogen, as haricot beans, may be used in the same way
as meat or cheese, and for the same <ins title="purpose.">purpose.&rsquo;</ins><a name="FNanchor_1_1" href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p>It is a pity that the value of haricot beans, peas, lentils,
and oatmeal is not more generally known. One writer says
that there is as much nourishment in 1&nbsp;lb. of either of these
as in 3&nbsp;lb. of lean meat; and in a lecture on the same subject,
another writer states that in three farthings' worth of oatmeal
there is as much nourishment as in a mutton chop.
These are certainly facts which should be known, especially
by people of limited means. Macaroni and semolina are
also valuable foods; they are prepared from the most
nutritious part of the wheat grain. Rice and maize are
deficient in flesh-forming properties, but useful as heat-giving
foods; so are, also, tapioca, cornflour, and sago.</p>

<p>Potatoes and fresh vegetables contain but little nourishment.
They must not, however, be despised on that account,
as they are most valuable additions to our daily diet on account
of the potash and other salts which they contain.
These vegetables help to keep the blood pure. The anti-scorbutic
properties of the potato are so great, that since its
introduction into England leprosy is said to have entirely
disappeared; neither is scurvy the scourge it was formerly.</p>

<p>The food taken daily should be in proportion to the work
done. A labouring man, for example, working hard each
day, would require such foods as liver and bacon, steak,
bullock's heart, beans, peas, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, &amp;c.;
foods, in fact, that would not be too easily digested. Hard
work causes the food to be assimilated more readily. A too
easily digested fare would cause a constant feeling of hunger.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11">11</a></span>For anyone, on the contrary, leading a sedentary life, the
food taken could not be too digestible. In that case, mutton,
plainly cooked chicken, soles, milk puddings, and lightly
boiled eggs should be the kind of viands chosen.</p>

<p>Children should have plain wholesome fare. Oatmeal
and bread are both excellent foods for them. The lime they
contain hardens their bones. The bread should be made
from seconds flour, which contains more flesh-forming and
mineral matter than the whiter and more sifted kinds.</p>

<p>Children should also have plenty of good milk. This is
of the greatest importance, especially for the first months
of a child's life. Milk is the only perfect food, and contains
all that is necessary to sustain healthy life. It is also the
only food a child can properly digest, until it cuts its teeth.
The improper feeding of children is the great cause of infant
mortality. When it becomes advisable to add to milk other
foods, they should be nutritious and well cooked. Fine oatmeal
or baked flour are, perhaps, the two best. Dr.
Fothergill says: &lsquo;Children fed on the food of their seniors,
or rich cake, and crammed with sweeties, do not as a rule
thrive well. They cannot compare favourably with children
fed on oatmeal, maize, and milk. Oatmeal is recovering
its position as a nursery food, after its temporary banishment.
Oatmeal porridge is the food <i>par excellence</i> of the
infants born north of the Trent, or was, at least, and
stalwart people were the results.&rsquo;</p>

<p>There is no doubt oatmeal is an excellent food, not for
children only, but for everyone, especially for those who
work hard. It is much to be regretted that it is not more
universally used. The English, as a rule, eat too much
animal food; and do not give sufficient attention to the
proper preparation of vegetables.</p>

<p>Oatmeal water is considered a most strengthening
beverage, and is used by men in foundries when beer and
fermented liquors would be found too heating.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12">12</a></span>
Of alcoholic drinks, Mr. Buckmaster says (echoing the
opinion of eminent physiologists): &lsquo;<span class="smcap">Beer</span>, <span class="smcap">wine</span>, and
<span class="smcap">spirits</span> are never to be regarded as foods. Their popular
use is entirely due to their stimulating properties. They
contain no nitrogen, and are therefore not flesh-formers, nor
can they add anything to the wasting tissues. All stimulants
act by increasing, for a time, the vitality of the body;
but this activity is always followed by depression in proportion
to the previous excitement. <span class="smcap">Tea</span> and <span class="smcap">coffee</span> do, to
some extent, prevent waste; but their value as foods depends
mainly on the sugar and milk taken with them; and their
use, <i>instead of food</i>, is almost as hurtful as intoxicating
drinks. <span class="smcap">Cocoa</span> differs very much from either tea or coffee,
since it is a nutritious liquid food.&rsquo;</p>

<p>In a lecture on the action of alcohol upon health, Sir
Andrew Clark says of health: &lsquo;That it is a state which
cannot be benefited by alcohol in any degree.&rsquo; He also
states: &lsquo;It is capable of proof, beyond all possibility of
question, that alcohol, <i>in ordinary circumstances, not only
does not help work, but is a serious hindrance of work</i>.&rsquo;</p>

<p>These facts are so important, and ought to be so universally
known, that it is to be hoped before long the
chemistry of food will occupy the place it should as one of
the most necessary branches of everyone's education.</p>

<h2><a name="table">THE TABLE.</a></h2>

<div style="font-size: 0.9em; width: 30em; margin: 2em auto;"><p>A properly cooked meal, and a neatly arranged dinner-table, are
helps to the happiness and moral progress of the humblest of
families.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Buckmaster.</span></p></div>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">A really</span> capable housekeeper will not be satisfied with
good cookery only. She will be careful to have each dish
nicely served, however plain it may be. Culture, or the
want of it, will be seen at once in the appointment of her
table. This remark does not apply to a profusion of glass,
silver, or flowers&mdash;these are questions of wealth&mdash;but to
the neatness and order with which a table is laid, and the
manner in which the meal is served.</p>

<p>Some people are particularly sensitive to external impressions;
and to them a dinner, or any other meal, however
costly, served in an untidy room, with table-cloth
soiled, silver tarnished, glasses smeared, and above all a
slovenly servant, would be enough to give a feeling of
depression that would anything but aid digestion.</p>

<p>A great point to be attended to is to have everything
perfectly clean and orderly, however old and plain. Clean
table-cloths make a wonderful difference to the look of a
table; a few flowers also will do much to give it a bright
appearance. Servants should be neat in their dress, and
quiet in their movements. If only one is kept, that is no
reason why she should wait at table in a slovenly dress and
with ruffled hair.</p>

<p>The dining-room should be, if possible, a bright room
with a good aspect. Heavy, sombre furniture, however
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14">14</a></span>fashionable, should be avoided. It is unfortunate that so
little attention is paid to the influence of colour; a warm
colouring will do much to give a bright look to a room
which would otherwise be dull.</p>

<p>The influence of the mental emotions on the digestion
is so great that it is important that the conversation at
meals should be as cheerful as possible, and no unpleasant
subject should be discussed: anything that disturbs the
appetite disturbs the digestion also.</p>

<p>With these points carefully attended to&mdash;a bright
room, neatly-laid table, well-cooked food, and cheerful conversation&mdash;dinner,
or any other meal, will become what it
should be, a refreshment to both mind and body.</p>

<h2 style="line-height: 2em;"><a name="how_to_cook">HOW TO COOK.</a><br/>
<small>Hints to Beginners.</small></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">A few</span> hints to beginners on the proper way to set about
their work may be, perhaps, of some use; as I know
many people get disgusted with cookery at the very outset,
and after one attempt, form a resolution never to enter the
kitchen again. They have spent the whole morning trying
to make a single dish, and that has proved a failure; they
have become hot, tired, and irritable, and ill able to bear
the laughter their failure has excited. There has been a
waste of material to no purpose, and they conclude, therefore,
that it is useless for <i>them</i> to make any further attempts.
At any rate, they determine that they will not
try again &lsquo;just yet;&rsquo; and that often means that they do
not try again at all. This disappointment and fatigue is
generally the result of want of method and forethought.
A recipe has been taken into the kitchen to be tried; very
probably one half of the terms used in it have not been
understood by the would-be cook. She at once begins to
make the dish, going to the recipe to look for each article
required as she wants to use it. If some of the supplies
have run short, she has perhaps to wait in the middle of
her operations while she sends to purchase them. Moreover,
when the cake, pastry, or whatever it may be, is
made, the fire has very likely been forgotten. In this way,
even if the dish has been properly prepared, it is
spoiled in the cooking.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16">16</a></span>
Those, too, who have some knowledge of the art and
perhaps, can cook fairly well, will often find the work a
great fatigue and toil. They spend double or treble the
time they need in the kitchen, just for the want of a little
judicious management.</p>

<p>Before trying a recipe read it over, <i>carefully</i> notice how
a dish is to be cooked, and make up the fire accordingly.
If it is pastry, take means to get the oven hot; if a boiled
pudding, make a good fire, and put a large saucepan of
water on to cook it in before doing anything else. When
this most important matter is attended to, put all the
materials required on the table with the weights and
scales; notice what cooking utensils will be required, see
that they are all clean and ready for use, and put them
near to hand. If, for example, you want to make a cake,
proceed in this manner:&mdash;Attend first to the fire to get
the oven lightly heated, then put out the weights and
scales and all necessary materials; put a basin on the
table for mixing, two or three cups for breaking eggs in,
one or two plates to put the different ingredients on as
they are measured, a grater, and anything else that may
be required. Then carefully weigh the materials, taking
the exact quantities named in the recipe. Prepare them
all before mixing any of them. Wash and pick over the
currants, and while they are drying, cut up all the candied
peel; beat up the eggs, and grease and prepare the cake-tin.
The butter should then be rubbed into the flour, and
the other dry ingredients should be added. The cake
should then be quickly mixed, put into its tin, and placed
at once in a hot oven.</p>

<p>If several dishes are to be made, a little thought beforehand
will often prevent a very great deal of fatigue and
waste of time. Suppose, for example, that you wish to
prepare two or three dishes for supper and to make some
cakes for tea. You have, perhaps, decided to have a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17">17</a></span>chicken coated with Béchamel sauce, a <i>gâteau</i> of apples
with whipped cream, a custard pudding, and some rock
cakes. Make, the day before, if possible, a list of the
articles required for the different dishes, and order what is
necessary in good time, so that there may be no delay the
next morning. Have the kitchen quite clear from all litters
before you begin to work. No one can cook well in a
muddle. Then commence operations by making up the
fire and putting a saucepan of stock, or water, on to boil
for the chicken. Next put the gelatine to soak for the
<i>gâteau</i>, not forgetting a little in the Béchamel sauce. The
longer gelatine soaks, the more quickly it will dissolve.
Then slice the apples and put them to stew with the sugar,
so that they may be cooking while you are preparing
something else. Afterwards truss the chicken; and probably,
by the time it is ready, the water or stock in the
saucepan will be boiling. Put the chicken into it to simmer
gently, noticing the time, so that it may not be over-cooked.
Then prepare the ingredients for the rock cakes;
mixing them&mdash;as they require a quick oven&mdash;before the
pudding. While they are cooking, prepare the custard;
and by the time it is made, the cakes, if the oven is properly
hot, will be sufficiently set to admit of the heat being
moderated. Now make the Béchamel sauce; strain it and
add the dissolved gelatine. Take up the chicken, remove
the skewers, place it on a dish, and coat it nicely with the
sauce. Then rub the apples through the sieve, and finish
making the <i>gâteau</i>. By this time the chicken, <i>gâteau</i>, and
rock cakes are made, and the custard will be cooking.
While waiting for the custard, whip the cream for the
<i>gâteau</i> and put it on a sieve to drain; prepare any decorations
you may intend to put on the fowl, and lay them on
a plate near to it in the pantry, ready to put on just before
serving. Everything will now be ready. With just a little
management, even a slow worker would scarcely take a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18">18</a></span>longer time to make these dishes than an hour and a
half.</p>

<p>Whatever failures and disappointments you may meet
with at first, do not be discouraged. Success is certain if
you will only have a little patience and perseverance. Do
not be disheartened because you feel very awkward, and
because you not unfrequently forget the oven, and let your
cakes and pastry burn. Try not to mind the banter of
your relations and friends at any possible failure. Many
well-meaning efforts to acquire this useful knowledge have
been nipped in the bud by the thoughtless, silly way in
which some people will laugh at any mistake or blunder.
A cake which has caught in baking, or a pudding with the
sugar left out, will probably afford them an inexhaustible
subject of mirth. Make up your mind, however, not
to be discouraged by any of these things. Practice will
give nimbleness to your fingers and strength to your
memory. As regards any laughter your mistakes may
cause, only persevere, and it will not be long before the
laugh will be on your side. But keep in mind in any of
your attempts that you must be <i>exact</i> in all you do. If
you try to cook without paying strict attention to weights
of the materials to be used and to the other directions, you
will deserve to fail. Be very particular in measuring
quantities; bear in mind that carelessness in this respect
is no mark of a superior cook as some people imagine, but
rather of a careless or ignorant one.</p>

<p>As whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well,
bring all your intelligence to bear upon what you take
in hand.</p>

UTENSILS.</a></h2>


<h3>Iron Saucepans.</h3>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Immerse</span> them in a pan of hot water with soda in it, and
wash them thoroughly inside and out, taking care that
nothing is left sticking to the bottom of the saucepans. If
anything has been burnt in them, boil some strong soda
and water in them before washing them, and then rub the
bottom of the saucepan with sand until it is quite clean.
The sand must be used nearly dry; if too much wetted it
loses its power.</p>

<p>The saucepan lids should be thoroughly rinsed and dried.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Enamel Saucepans.</h3>

<p>Wash them thoroughly in hot water with soda in it,
using soap if necessary. If anything has been burnt in the
saucepan, boil strong soda and water in it before cleaning
it, and rub it well with sand. Rinse and dry thoroughly.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Anglo-American Saucepans.</h3>

<p>Clean like enamel saucepans. They should be kept
perfectly clean inside and out.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Tin Saucepans.</h3>

<p>Clean these like iron saucepans.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20">20</a></span></p>
<h3>Dish Covers and Jelly Moulds.</h3>

<p>Wash with soap and water and dry thoroughly. Powder
some whiting, and mix with a little cold water;
brush the mixture over the covers and moulds; when
dry, rub off with a plate brush or soft cloth or leather.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>To Clean a Roaster.</h3>

<p>Wash the dripping-pan and inside of the roaster with
hot water and soda to remove all grease, then rub them
with sand until they are quite bright, rinse and dry
thoroughly. Clean the outside of the roaster with whiting,
used according to directions given for cleaning dish
covers.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Hair and Wire Sieves.</h3>

<p>Wash these thoroughly with hot water with soda in it,
and scrub them quite clean with a sieve-brush. Dry them
thoroughly, and keep them in a <i>dry place</i>. If this is not
done a hair sieve will get mildewed, an iron one rusty, and
a copper one will verdigris and become poisonous. Copper-wire
sieves should always have especial care.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Paste Boards and Rolling Pins.</h3>

<p>Scrub them well with hot water and sand. Do not use
soda, as it will make the wood yellow.</p>

<h3>To Clean a Close Stove or Open Range.</h3>

<p>Scrape out all the ashes and brush up all the dust.
Then, with a brush, thoroughly clean the flues. Brush the
stove over with liquid blacklead, and when it is dry polish
with brushes. Then clean any steel about the stove and
the fire-irons and fender with emery-paper; any brass with
brick-dust well rubbed on with a leather.</p>

<p>Brush all the dust from the oven, and wipe it round

<h2><a name="rules_boiling">RULES FOR BOILING.</a></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">All</span> meat, with the exception of salt meat, should be put
into boiling water, and should be well boiled for quite five
minutes, in order that the albumen on the outside of the
joint may be set. The hardened albumen forms a kind of
casing. This casing serves to keep in, as far as possible, the
flavour and juices of the meat. When the meat has been
boiled sufficiently long to effect this hardening, the kettle
should be drawn to one side of the fire. The water should
be kept at simmering point until the joint is cooked. The
general rule, as regards time required for boiling, is a
quarter of an hour for each pound of meat and a quarter of
an hour over. But only general rules can be given, as the
time will vary according to the nature of the joint to be
cooked. A thick piece of meat will necessarily take longer
to cook than a thin piece with much bone, although both
may be the same weight. Very <i>fresh</i> meat will also take
longer to cook than that which has been hung.</p>

<p>As soon as the water boils, after the meat is in it, the
scum should be carefully removed from time to time, while
it is cooking. If the scum be allowed to boil down, it will
settle on the joint and discolour it. It is best, however, as
a precaution, to wrap the meat in a very clean cloth; this
will effectually preserve its colour. Salt meat should be put
into lukewarm water, for the purpose of drawing out some
of the salt. It should be simmered gently, allowing always
twenty minutes to the pound, and twenty minutes over.
Salt hardens the fibre of the meat; it, therefore, requires to
be cooked for a longer time to make it tender.</p>

putting on coal or coke at the back. The live coals should
be drawn to the front to prevent smoke. Fasten the joint
to the jack. Place the roaster close to the fire for the first
ten minutes, so that the heat of the fire may at once harden
the albumen, and form a case to keep in the flavour and
juices. Afterwards, draw the roaster farther back and cook
gradually, basting every ten minutes. The basting keeps
the meat from drying up, and gives it a better flavour. The
length of time allowed for roasting is the same as for boiling,
the rule being a quarter of an hour for each pound, and a
quarter of an hour over. For white meat, veal and pork, or
solid joints without bone, allow twenty minutes to the pound,
and twenty minutes over. These rules, however, cannot
always be strictly adhered to, as the size and shape of the
joint must be taken into consideration, as well as the weight.
Meat that has been frozen will take longer to cook than
fresh meat. Meat which has been well hung will take a
shorter time than fresh meat. If a jack is not used, the
joint should be fastened to a rope of worsted, which should
be kept constantly turning.</p>

<p>Gravy, for a joint, may be made according to two
methods. The first method is to take the dripping-pan
away half an hour before the joint is cooked, then to put a
hot dish in its place, and to pour the contents of the pan
into a basin. Put the basin into a refrigerator; or, place
it on ice. As soon as it is cold, the fat will cake on the top
of the gravy, and should be removed very carefully. Make
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24">24</a></span>the gravy hot, diluting it with warm water, if necessary,
and pour it round the joint.</p>

<p>The other and more usual method of making gravy, is
to pour away all the fat from the pan as soon as the joint
is cooked; and then pour into the pan a sufficient quantity
of hot water, scraping well the brown glaze from the bottom;
colour carefully with caramel, or burnt sugar, and pour it
<i>round</i> the joint, not <i>over</i> it. Pouring the gravy over the
meat destroys its crispness.</p>

<p>On no account make gravy from stock; stock is quite
unsuitable, as the vegetable flavour is, to many persons,
disagreeable.</p>

<h2><a name="rules_frying">RULES FOR FRYING.</a></h2>


<h3><a name="french_frying">French or Wet Frying.</a></h3>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">This</span> is cooking in a large quantity of fat sufficient to cover
the articles fried in it. Oil, lard, dripping, or fat rendered
down, may be used for this purpose. Oil is considered the
best, as it will rise to 600° without burning; other fats get
over-heated after 400°, and therefore require greater care
in using. Success depends, almost entirely, on getting the
fat to the right degree of heat. For ordinary frying, the
heat required is 345°. Unless this point is carefully attended
to, total failure will be the result. There are signs, however,
by which anyone may easily tell when the fat is ready
for use. It must be quite still, making no noise; noise, or
bubbling, will be caused by the evaporation of moisture, or
water in it. The expression, &lsquo;boiling lard,&rsquo; or &lsquo;boiling fat,&rsquo;
has been misleading to many inexperienced cooks, who, not
unnaturally, imagine that when the fat is bubbling, like
boiling water, it is boiling, and, therefore, at the right heat.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25">25</a></span>But boiling <i>fat</i> does not bubble. When it has the appearance
of boiling water, it is simply due, as already explained,
to the presence of water in it, which must pass away by evaporation,
before the fat can reach the required heat. When
it ceases to make any noise, and is quite still, it should be
carefully watched; for very soon a pale blue vapour is seen
rising, and then the fat is sufficiently hot. If, from the
position of the stove, it is not easy to see this vapour, a
piece of bread may be held in the fat as a test; if it begins
to turn brown, in about a minute, the fat is ready. It
should then be used without delay; since, when once hot
enough, it rapidly gets overheated or burnt. Fat is burning
when the blue vapour becomes like smoke. Burnt fat has
an unpleasant smell, and is apt to give a disagreeable taste
to the articles fried in it. With ordinary care fat need not
get overheated. Next to oil, fat rendered down (<i>see</i> <a href="#rendering_down_fat">Rendering
down Fat</a>), is best for the purpose. If strained after
each time of using, and not allowed to burn, it will keep
good for months, and may be used for fish, sweets, or
savouries, and no taste of anything previously fried in it
will be given to the articles cooked. For this kind of frying,
a kitchener, or gas stove, is preferable to an open range.</p>

<p>All kinds of rissoles, croquettes, fillets and cutlets of fish,
fritters, &amp;c., should be fried in this manner, and should not
be darker than a golden brown. It is an advantage to use
a frying-basket for all such things as are covered with egg
and bread-crumbs; but fritters, or whatever is dipped in
batter, should be dropped into the fat, as they become so
light that they rise to the top of it. When they are a pale
fawn colour on the one side, they should be turned over to
the other. Care must be taken to drain everything, after
frying, on kitchen paper in order to remove any grease.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26">26</a></span></p>
<h3>Dry Frying.</h3>

<p>This is frying in a cutlet or frying pan, with a small
quantity of fat, and is only suitable for such things as
require slow cooking, such as steaks, mutton or veal cutlets,
fillets of beef, liver and bacon. Pancakes also are fried in
this manner. Success depends, as in French frying, in
having the fat rightly heated, taking care that the outside
of the meat cooked be sealed up. In this way the juices
and flavour will be retained in it. Make, therefore, the
frying-pan hot, then put in the fat; and when that is also
perfectly hot, put in the meat to be cooked. When each
side has been well sealed up, the heat applied must be
moderated, so that the cooking may be gradual. The
common mistake in this kind of frying is to put the meat
into the fat when it is but barely melted; the juices of the
meat are thus allowed to escape, and the meat is toughened.</p>



<div class="new-h2">&nbsp;</div>
<h2><a name="rules_baking">RULES FOR BAKING.</a></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">To</span> bake meat successfully, the oven must be well ventilated,
otherwise, the joint cooked in this manner will have an
unpleasant flavour. The meat should be put on a trivet,
which should be placed on a baking-tin. The oven must
be very hot when the meat is put into it, and the heat
should be kept up for the first quarter of an hour. This is
to form the casing already alluded to in the directions for
roasting and boiling; the heat of the oven must then be
very much moderated, and the joint cooked very gradually,
allowing twenty minutes for every pound, and twenty
minutes over. The meat should be basted; and the gravy
may be made in the same manner as in roasting.</p>

<h2><a name="rules_grilling">RULES FOR GRILLING.</a></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">For</span> this method of cookery, a clear fire is essential. The
griller is warmed, and the meat fastened in it. It is then
hung on the bars of the fireplace, and a dish passed underneath
to catch any gravy. An ordinary sized chop, cooked
in this way, will take about five minutes on the one side,
and three on the other.</p>



<div class="new-h2">&nbsp;</div>
<h2><a name="rules_broiling">RULES FOR BROILING.</a></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">This</span> is cooking over the fire on a gridiron. The flavour of
broiled meat is usually preferred to that of grilled. Put the
gridiron over the fire to heat, and then put the chop,
or steak, on it; place the gridiron close to the fire at first,
that the heat may rapidly seal up the outside of the meat.
When this has been accomplished, lift the gridiron further
from the fire, and cook gradually, turning occasionally. A
clear fire is essential. Coke is better than coal for broiling,
because there is less smoke from it.</p>

<h2><a name="sauces">SAUCES.</a></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Sauces</span> are often failures, chiefly because they are not made
of a proper consistency; and because the flour in them is
not sufficiently cooked. It should be remembered that the
starch in flour wants to be <i>well boiled</i>, otherwise it will be
indigestible, and the sauce will have a raw, pasty taste. A
sauce is not ready when it <i>thickens</i>, but should be boiled
for quite three minutes. Its consistency should depend on
what it is to be used for. Ordinary sauces, served in a sauce
tureen, should be fairly thick; the proportions taken should
be 1&nbsp;oz. of butter; ¾&nbsp;oz. of flour; ½ pint of milk. If the
sauce is to be used to coat anything very thinly (new
potatoes, for example), ½&nbsp;oz. of flour, instead of ¾&nbsp;oz., would
be sufficient. If a sauce is required to entirely mask a small
piece of fish, or chicken, &amp;c., 1&nbsp;oz. of flour should be used,
with the proportions of milk and butter already given.
Every ingredient should be properly weighed or measured.
Carelessness in this respect is a mark of ignorance, and
<i>must</i> occasion failures.</p>

<p>For making most of the ordinary sauces, the butter is
melted first in a small stewpan, care being taken that it
does not discolour; the flour is then mixed with it. If the
mixing is not perfect, the sauce will be lumpy. The milk,
stock, or water, is then poured in, and the sauce is stirred
<i>one way</i>, until it has boiled three minutes. If cream is
used, it is then added, and allowed just to boil in the sauce.</p>

<p>In making economical sauces, when less butter and flour
are used (<i>see</i> <a href="#economical_family_sauce">Economical Family Sauce</a>), the method employed
is different. The flour is then mixed very smoothly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54">54</a></span>
with a little of the milk, water, or whatever is used, and
then added to the remainder, which may be cold or boiling;
but greater care is required to keep it smooth when the
liquid is poured in boiling.</p>

<h3><a name="mayonnaise_sauce">Mayonnaise Sauce.</a></h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;2 yolks of eggs.</li>
<li>1 gill of salad oil.</li>
<li>2 tablespoonfuls of taragon vinegar.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Put the yolks, which must be perfectly free
from the whites, into a basin, which in summer time should
be placed on ice.</p>

<p>Work them well with a whisk or wooden spoon, adding
the oil drop by drop.</p>

<p>When the sauce is so thick that the whisk, or spoon, is
moved with difficulty, the oil may be added more quickly,
but still very gradually.</p>

<p>Lastly, add the taragon vinegar and seasoning.</p>

<p><i>Note.</i>&mdash;Success in making this sauce depends on first
dividing the yolks completely from the whites. Secondly, in
keeping them and the oil quite cold. Thirdly, on adding
the oil, drop by drop, until the sauce is perfectly thick. If
the sauce is made in a warm place, or the oil mixed in too
quickly, it is apt to curdle. Should this occur, put a yolk
in another basin and very slowly add the sauce to it, stirring
briskly; this will generally make it smooth again.
Two yolks will be sufficient for any quantity of sauce, taragon
vinegar being added in proportion to the oil used.</p>

<h3>Oatmeal Porridge.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;½&nbsp;lb. of coarse oatmeal.</li>
<li>1 quart of water.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Put the water on to boil.</p>

<p>When boiling, sprinkle in the oatmeal, stirring all the
time.</p>

<p>When it thickens, put it by the side of the fire, and stir
occasionally.</p>

<p>Cook it for quite three-quarters of an hour, longer if
possible.</p>

<p>When the time can be allowed, three hours will not be
too long a time, especially if the porridge is for anyone
with a weak digestion.</p>

<p>A better plan is to put the saucepan containing it, after
the contents have boiled for ten minutes, to stand in a
saucepan of briskly boiling water; it will then cook without
danger of burning, and may be left for any length of
time; care only being taken that the water in the under
saucepan does not boil away.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Whole-meal Porridge.</h3>

<p>This may be made in the same way as oatmeal, but it
requires even longer cooking.</p>

bright clear fire.</p>

<p>When ready, put it at once into the rack; because, if
the toast is placed flat on a table, it loses its crispness.</p>

<p>The crusts may be soaked for plain puddings, or dried
and powdered for bread crumbs.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Buttered Toast.</h3>

<p>Cut the bread about half an inch in thickness.</p>

<p>Toast quickly in front of a clear fire.</p>

<p>Put the butter on directly the toast is taken off the
fork, and spread it quickly.</p>

<p>Put the toast on a <i>hot</i> plate, and take care that it is
served hot.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>

Dutch oven or on a toasting fork until the fat is transparent.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Fried Bacon.</h3>

<p>Cut the bacon in thin slices, and fry it in its own fat.
It will be cooked when the fat is transparent. It must not
be cooked too quickly, or the fat will burn up and be
wasted.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Eggs and Bacon.</h3>

<p>Toast or fry the bacon, and lay a nicely poached egg
on each slice.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Boiled Eggs.</h3>

<p>Put the eggs into boiling water, and boil an ordinary
sized egg for three minutes; new-laid eggs will take one
minute longer. Eggs boiled five minutes will be nearly
hard. To make them quite firm, boil them steadily for
ten minutes. To make them mealy, boil them for an
hour.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71">71</a></span></p>
<h3>Poached Eggs.</h3>

<p>Eggs for poaching should be perfectly <i>fresh</i>, or they
will not keep a nice shape.</p>

<p>Let the water be quite boiling; add to it a little salt.</p>

<p>Break the eggs into cups, and slip them gently into the
boiling water.</p>

<p>As soon as the white is nicely set, remove them with a
fish slice.</p>

<p>Trim the eggs neatly, and serve them on hot buttered
toast.</p>

<p>An egg-poacher will be found very convenient for
cooking eggs this way.</p>

<li>1 slice of fried or toasted bread.</li>
<li>A little anchovy paste.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;oz. of butter.</li>

</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Let the fried or toasted bread be quite hot
(fried bread is the best), and spread it thinly with anchovy
paste.</p>

<p>Make the butter quite hot in a frying or omelet pan.</p>

<p>Break the eggs into it, add pepper and salt, and stir
very quickly, until they are a soft yellow mass.</p>

<p>Spread it quickly over the toast, and serve immediately.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Eggs in Cases.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;4 tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs.</li>
<li>1 dessertspoonful of finely-chopped parsley.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
<li>If liked, a boiled onion very finely chopped.</li>

<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Broiled Mushrooms.</h3>

<p>Choose nice large mushrooms; peel and wash them,
and wipe them dry.</p>

<p>Cut out the stems, and put them, with the top of the
mushrooms downwards, on a gridiron.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80">80</a></span>
Put a small piece of butter on each, and broil for ten
minutes slowly.</p>

<p>Remove them carefully, as the mushrooms will be by
that time full of delicious gravy.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Broiled Dried Haddock.</h3>

<p>Soak it in cold water for an hour before using.</p>

<p>Broil it slowly over a clear fire until it is quite hot,
turning occasionally.</p>

<p>Rub some butter over it, and serve it at once.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>

<p>Cut the bloaters open down the back, and bone them.</p>

<p>Lay them one on the other with the insides together.</p>

<p>Broil them slowly over a clear fire, turning occasionally.</p>

<p>Serve very hot, with a little butter rubbed over them.</p>

<p>If preferred, they may be broiled unboned.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>

<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Tea.</h3>

<p>Measure a teaspoonful of tea for each person, and one
teaspoonful over.</p>

<p>Make the teapot quite hot by filling it with boiling
water; let it stand in it for three minutes; then empty the
teapot.</p>

<p>Put in the tea, and pour boiling water over it.</p>

<p>Cover it with a tea-cosy, and let it infuse for five
minutes before using. The longer it stands, the darker it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81">81</a></span>
will get; but for people of weak digestions, it should be
used after five minutes' infusion only.</p>

<p>The water should be fresh spring water, and should be
used as soon as it boils. Water that has been boiled for
any length of time is flat from the loss of its gases.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Coffee.</h3>

<p>To have coffee to perfection it should be freshly roasted
and ground, as coffee quickly loses its flavour. If this is
not possible, use the best French coffee sold in tins. The
water should be freshly boiled; the coffee itself should <i>not</i>
be <i>boiled</i>, but only infused in the boiling water. Boiling
disperses the aroma. It can, however, be made more
economically if boiled, and therefore recipes are given for
its preparation in this manner. Chicory is generally used
with coffee in the proportion of two ounces of chicory to
one pound of coffee.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Coffee (Soyer's method.)</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;3&nbsp;oz. of coffee.</li>
<li>1 pint of boiling water.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Put the coffee into a clean stewpan.</p>

<p>Stir over the fire until it smokes, but do not let it burn.</p>

<p>Then pour in the boiling water.</p>

<p>Cover close, and set by the side of the fire for ten
minutes.</p>

<p>Strain through thick muslin.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Coffee (another method).</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;3&nbsp;oz. of coffee.</li>
<li>1½ pint of boiling water.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Make a jug hot.</p>

<p>Put the coffee in it, and pour over the boiling water.</p>

<p>Let it stand in a hot place for half an hour.</p>

<p>Then strain through thick muslin.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82">82</a></span></p>
<h3>Café au Lait.</h3>

<p>Half fill a cup with nicely-made coffee, and pour in the
same quantity of boiled milk.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Coffee (economical method).</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;¾&nbsp;lb. of coffee.</li>
<li>2 quarts of cold water.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Make a bag of rather thick muslin, and put
the coffee into it. The bag should be rather large, so that
the coffee will have plenty of room.</p>

<p>Tie the ends of the bag securely.</p>

<p>Put it into a saucepan with the water; bring to the
boil, and boil steadily for one hour.</p>

<p>Strain through thick muslin.</p>

<p>This will make strong coffee, which can be diluted with
boiling water as required.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Coffee made in a Percolator.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;3&nbsp;oz. of coffee.</li>
<li>1½ pint of boiling water.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Make the percolator hot.</p>

<p>Put the coffee in it, and pour on the boiling water.</p>

<p>Let it stand in a hot place for about ten minutes.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Cocoa.</h3>

<p>This is best, especially for invalids, if prepared from
the nibs; these should be perfectly fresh.</p>

<p>Put a quarter of a pound of nibs into two quarts of cold
water; simmer for five hours and then strain.</p>

<p>When cold remove the fat; heat it as required.</p>

<p>Cocoa may also be made from any of the different preparations.</p>

<p>Make it according to directions given on the canisters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83">83</a></span>,
and be very careful to mix it thoroughly. Nothing is so
unpleasant as to have the sides and bottom of the cup
coated with cocoa.</p>

<p>It is better to prepare it in a small saucepan; it should
be boiled for two or three minutes.</p>

<p>It is more nourishing if mixed with milk instead of
water.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Chocolate.</h3>

<p>This is only a thicker preparation of cocoa, and may be
made in the same way.</p>

<h3>Hash.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;The remains of cold meat.</li>
<li>Some nice stock or gravy.</li>
<li>Flour, in the proportion of ½&nbsp;oz. to every ½ pint of gravy.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt, and, if liked, a little catsup, or Harvey's sauce.</li>
<li>Toasted or fried bread.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Cut the meat into neat pieces.</p>

<p>Mix the flour smoothly with the gravy, and boil for
three minutes, stirring all the time.</p>

<p>Add seasoning and catsup or a little sauce.</p>

<p>Then put the pieces of meat into the gravy and let
them warm through; but do not let the gravy <i>boil</i> when
the meat is in it, as that would toughen it.</p>

<p>Tinned oysters make a nice addition to a hash.</p>

<p>For serving, put the hash on a hot dish and garnish
with sippets of fried or toasted bread.</p>

<p>If no gravy or stock is available, make some by breaking
up any bones from the meat; boil them in a sufficient
quantity of water, with a piece of carrot, turnip,
onion, celery, and a small bunch of herbs.</p>

<p>Boil for quite an hour, and then strain the liquor.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Minced Meat.</h3>

<i>Method.</i>&mdash;Mince the meat finely with a knife, or mincing
machine (the flavour is nicer if a knife is used).</p>

<p>Mix with sufficient gravy to moisten the meat, and stir
over the fire until hot; but do not let the gravy boil.</p>

<p>Serve with a border of boiled rice, or mashed potatoes
round it.</p>

<p>If veal or chicken is minced, squeeze in a few drops of
lemon juice, and serve with sliced lemon.</p>

<p>A little cooked ham should be added to these minces,
to give them flavour; minced beef is improved by the addition
of a few oysters.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Mince (with Eggs).</h3>

<p>Prepare some mince, as in preceding recipe, and serve
with very nicely poached eggs on the top of it; garnish
with sippets of fried or toasted bread.</p>

<h2><a name="fish">FISH COOKERY.</a></h2>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>To Boil Fish.</h3>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Be</span> very careful that the fish is thoroughly cleansed, then
place it on the fish-strainer, and tie a cloth, or piece of
muslin, over it. (This is to prevent any scum settling on
the fish to disfigure it, or spoil its colour.) Immerse it in
boiling water, to which two tablespoonfuls of salt, and two
of vinegar, have been added; boil it for three minutes to set
the albumen on the outside, and so form a casing to keep
in the juices and flavour of the fish. Then draw the kettle
to the side of the fire and simmer gently until the fish is
cooked. For a thick piece of fish, six minutes to each
pound, and six minutes over, is the time usually allowed;
but no hard-and-fast rule can be laid down, as the time it
will take to cook depends on the size and shape, as well as
on the weight of the fish. When the fish is cooked, it will
have an opaque appearance; and on being pulled, will leave
the bone readily. Care must be taken to cook it sufficiently
but not to over-boil it. Under-done fish is very unpleasant,
while over-cooked fish is flavourless, and breaks to pieces.</p>

<p>Salt fish is put into lukewarm water for the purpose of
drawing out some of the salt, and must be simmered until
tender. Mackerel should also be put into lukewarm water,
as the skin is very tender, and boiling water would break it.</p>

<p>When the fish is cooked, remove the cloth, or muslin,
and place the strainer across the kettle that the fish may
get well drained. Cover it with a hot cover, and leave it in
that position for a few minutes. Then dish, on a folded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112">112</a></span>
napkin; or on a strainer, if sauce is poured over it. Garnish
tastefully, and serve with an appropriate sauce. Small
cod, or salmon, if boiled whole, should be trussed in the
form of the letter S.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Baked Fish.</h3>

<p>The oven should be kept at a moderate heat, that the
fish may not be dried up. Small fish may be cooked with
great advantage in the oven, if carefully covered with
buttered paper, which will keep them moist, and prevent
any baked flavour.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Fried Fish.</h3>

<p>Small fish, such as whiting, smelts, &amp;c., are generally
fried whole. Larger fish, such as cod and salmon, are fried
in the shape of cutlets. Fish to be fried, must be covered with
egg and crumbs, or batter. A stewpan, half full of fat, and
not a frying-pan, should be used for the purpose (<i>see</i> <a href="#french_frying">French
Frying</a>), except in the case of the sole; and for that, the new
fish-fryer, with a wire strainer, is far better than the old-fashioned
pan. The bread-crumbs, for fish, should be prepared
by rubbing stale bread through a wire sieve.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Boiled Turbot.</h3>

<p>Boil it according to the directions for boiling fish. It
usually takes from half an hour to an hour, according to
its size. It should be dished on a folded napkin, with the
white side uppermost; and garnished with cut lemon,
parsley, and coral. Serve with it lobster, shrimp, or
anchovy sauce.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Boiled Brill.</h3>

<p>This fish is cooked like turbot; garnished in the same
way, and served with the same sauces.</p>

<h3>Boiled Salmon.</h3>

Truss a small salmon in the form of the letter S. Dish on
a folded napkin; and garnish with parsley and coral. Serve
with lobster, shrimp, anchovy, or tartare sauce.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Boiled Cod.</h3>

<p>Boil according to directions given for boiling fish. A
small piece is often served with thick egg-sauce poured over
it, and garnished with the yolk of an egg rubbed through a
wire sieve.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Salt Cod, Haddock, Plaice, and any Fish,</h3>

<h2><a name="pastry">PASTRY.</a></h2>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Few</span> people are successful in making pastry. Yet, with
a little practice, there is no reason why any one should not
make it with some degree of perfection, if the following
rules are carefully attended to.</p>

<p>Make the pastry in a cool place, not in a hot kitchen.
The board, rolling-pin, and hands should be as cold as
possible. Handle it very lightly. The colder pastry is
kept during making, the lighter it will be, because it will
contain more air; cold air occupies a much less space than
warm. The colder the air, the greater, consequently, will
be its expansion when the pastry is put into a very hot
oven. Roll the paste lightly, and not more than necessary.
Puff paste is a kind of fine sandwich. There should be a
certain number of layers of dough and layers of butter.
Take care, therefore, that the butter is not allowed to break
through the dough; and be <i>very careful to follow</i> the
directions given for making this pastry. Its manufacture
requires patience, because, if it is not properly cooled
between the turns, the friction of rolling will warm the
butter, and cause it to smear into the dough. For short
crust, rub the butter or fat lightly into the flour with the
tips of the fingers; and do not use more water than necessary
in mixing it. This is a common mistake; and too
much water deprives the paste of its shortness. Short
paste is the best for children and persons of weak digestion;
the flour in it being more thoroughly incorporated
with the fat, gets better cooked. It is, therefore, capable
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134">134</a></span>of more perfect mastication than puff or flaky crust, both
of which are liable to be swallowed in flakes.</p>

<p>However well pastry is made, success will not be
attained unless the oven is rightly heated. The very
lightest crusts will often be totally spoiled in the baking
because this important point is not attended to. If the
oven is not very hot, the fat will melt and run out of the
pastry before the starch grains in the flour burst; consequently,
they cannot afterwards expand, however hot the
oven may be made; and in this way the paste will become
heavy. Take great care, therefore, that the oven is very
hot when the paste is put into it.</p>

<p>Watch the paste carefully that it does not take too dark
a colour. When it is well thrown up and nearly cooked, it
may be removed to a more moderately heated part of the
oven if it should appear to be browning too quickly.</p>

<p>Ovens in which the heat comes from the bottom are
decidedly the best for either cakes or pastry; but no one
should expect to bake well in an oven they do not thoroughly
understand. There is so much difference in ovens, that
the hottest part of one may be the coolest in another. To
bake well requires practice and experience, and no one
should be discouraged by a few failures.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Puff Paste.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;Equal quantities of Vienna flour and butter.</li>
<li>A few drops of lemon juice.</li>
<li>Enough water to mix the flour into a nice lithe dough.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Rub the flour through a wire sieve.</p>

<p>Make a well in the middle, and squeeze in a few drops
of lemon juice.</p>

<p>Mix very gradually with very cold water, taking care
that the dough is not too stiff.</p>

<p>Then knead and work well about until quite smooth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135">135</a></span>
Set it aside for a few minutes to get quite cold.</p>

<p>Squeeze the butter in a cloth to press out the water.</p>

<p>Roll out the dough, and place the butter, flattened to a
third of its size, in the middle.</p>

<p>Then fold the dough from either side over it, pressing
the edges together.</p>

<p>Turn it with its edges toward you, and roll out very
gently (care must be taken that the butter does not break
through the dough).</p>

<p>Fold it again in three, and put it aside to cool for quite
a quarter of an hour. The colder it is kept the better.</p>

<p>Then turn its edges towards you, and roll it out again;
fold evenly in three, and roll and fold again in the same
manner; each roll and fold is called a turn.</p>

<p>Cool the paste for another quarter of an hour.</p>

<p>Then give it two more turns.</p>

<p>Let it cool again; and at the seventh roll it will probably
be ready for use.</p>

<p>It is, however, wise to bake a small piece of the paste
before using the whole quantity. If the maker has a very
light hand it sometimes happens that eight or even nine
turns may be necessary to roll the butter sufficiently into
the flour.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Patty Cases.</h3>

<p>Roll the puff paste, when ready, to rather more than a
quarter of an inch in thickness.</p>

<p>Take a fluted cutter about the size of a tumbler.</p>

<p>Dip it in very hot water, and cut the paste into rounds
with it.</p>

<p>Mark the middle of these rounds with a cutter about
three sizes smaller.</p>

<p>Roll out the remains of the paste to half the thickness
of the patties.</p>

<p>Stamp out some rounds for covers with a fluted cutter
two sizes smaller than that used for the cases.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136">136</a></span>
Put the cases and covers on a baking-tin, and bake in a
quick oven for ten or fifteen minutes.</p>

<p>When cooked, lift the lid and scrape out the soft inside
carefully.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Good Short Crust.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;1&nbsp;lb. of flour.</li>
<li>¾&nbsp;lb. of butter.</li>
<li>Enough cold water to mix rather stiffly.</li>
<li>A pinch of salt.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Rub the butter into the flour until like fine
bread-crumbs.</p>

<p>Mix with cold water, using as little as possible (if too
much is used the crust will not be short).</p>

<p>Roll gently to make the paste bind.</p>

<p>If this paste is used for tarts, add one dessertspoonful
of castor sugar to the flour.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Plainer Short Crust.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;1&nbsp;lb. of flour.</li>
<li>¼&nbsp;lb. of butter.</li>
<li>¼&nbsp;lb. of lard.</li>
<li>1 teaspoonful of baking powder.</li>

</ul>

<p>To make this crust still plainer, a quarter of a pound
only of clarified dripping or lard may be taken, and three
good teaspoonfuls of baking powder.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137">137</a></span>
<i>Method.</i>&mdash;Make according to the directions for Short
Crust.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Flaky Crust.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;1&nbsp;lb. of flour.</li>
<li>½&nbsp;lb. of butter or dripping.</li>
<li>A pinch of salt.</li>
<li>Enough cold water to mix the paste.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Rub one half of the butter into the flour, as
for short crust.</p>

<p>Mix with the water, and roll it out very thinly.</p>

<p>Put the remainder in little pieces on the paste.</p>

<p>Fold in three, and then in three again.</p>

<p>Roll out to the size required.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Rough Puff Paste.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;1&nbsp;lb. of flour.</li>

with the fat.</p>

<p>Fold in two.</p>

<p>Spread again with fat.</p>

<p>Fold in two, and spread once more with fat.</p>

<p>Fold again, and set aside for one hour.</p>

<p>Then roll out and use.</p>

<h3>Beef-steak Pie.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;2&nbsp;lb. of nice beef-steak.</li>
<li>½&nbsp;lb. of bullock's kidney.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;lb. of flaky or rough puff paste.</li>
<li>1 tablespoonful of flour.</li>
<li>½ pint of water.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Roll the paste to a quarter of an inch in
thickness.</p>

<p>Invert the pie-dish, and cut the paste to the size and
shape of the under side of it.</p>

<p>Roll out the remainder, and cut a band one inch
wide.</p>

<p>Wet the edge of the pie-dish, and place this round it.</p>

<p>Cut the beef into thin strips.</p>

<p>Dip them in flour, and season with pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Roll each of the strips round a tiny piece of fat.</p>

<p>Put them into the pie-dish alternately with pieces of
kidney.</p>

<p>Raise them in the middle of the dish in a dome-like
form, and pour in the water.</p>

<p>Wet the edges of the paste lining of the dish, and lay
the cover over.</p>

<p>Press the edges lightly together, and trim round with a
knife.</p>

<p>Make a hole in the middle of the paste to let the gases
from the meat escape.</p>

<p>Brush the crust with beaten egg, and decorate with
leaves cut from the trimmings.</p>

<p>Bake for about two hours.</p>

<p>The pie should be put into a quick oven until the pastry
is cooked; the heat must then be moderated to cook the
meat thoroughly without drying up the pastry. If possible,
finish cooking the meat on the top of the oven.</p>

<p>Some people prefer stewing the meat before using it in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139">139</a></span>the pie. If this is done, it must be allowed to get cold
before the pie is made.</p>

<p>It is an improvement to the pie to put layers of oysters,
bearded, alternately with the rolls of beef.</p>

<h2><a name="puddings">PUDDINGS.</a></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">A pudding</span> which is to be boiled should be placed in a
well-greased basin, or mould, which it should quite fill.
A scalded and floured cloth should be tied securely over it.
Some puddings, such as suet, plum, &amp;c., may be cooked
without the basin, the mixture being firmly tied in a well-scalded
and floured cloth, a little room being allowed for
the pudding to swell. When cooked in this way, it is well
to put a plate in the saucepan to prevent the pudding
sticking to the bottom and burning.</p>

<p>To cook a boiled pudding successfully, the water should
be kept briskly boiling during the whole of the time it is
cooking, and there should be sufficient water in the saucepan
to well cover it. A kettle of boiling water should be
at hand to fill up the saucepan as required. In steaming
puddings, unless a steamer is used, the water should not
be allowed to come more than halfway up the pudding-mould,
and must only gently simmer, until the pudding is
cooked. The mould used need not be covered with a cloth,
but a piece of greased paper should be placed over it to
prevent the condensed steam dropping on the pudding.
Some puddings require to be steamed very carefully, such
as contain custard, for example. A custard pudding will
be honeycombed (i.e. full of holes), if the water is allowed
to boil; the heat of boiling will curdle the eggs.</p>

<p>Most baked puddings require a moderate oven, particularly
such as rice, tapioca, &amp;c.</p>

<p>In preparing suet for puddings, remove the skin, slice
the suet, and then chop it finely, using a little flour to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152">152</a></span>prevent it sticking to the knife. Currants must be well
washed and dried. Sultanas should be rubbed in flour,
and the stalks picked off.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Beef-steak Pudding.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;1&nbsp;lb. of flour.</li>
<li>¾ or ½&nbsp;lb. of suet.</li>
<li>1½&nbsp;lb. of beef or rump steak.</li>
<li>½&nbsp;lb. of bullock's kidney.</li>
<li>Seasoning.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Chop the suet finely, mix well with the flour,
adding a pinch of salt.</p>

<p>Mix to a paste with cold water.</p>

<p>Roll it out, and line a greased quart-basin, reserving
one-third for the cover.</p>

<p>Cut the steak into thin strips, and the kidney into
slices.</p>

<p>Mix some pepper and salt on a plate, and season the
meat nicely.</p>

<p>Roll each piece of meat round a tiny piece of the
fat, and place the rolls and the pieces of kidney in the
basin.</p>

<p>Pour in rather more than a quarter of a pint of water.</p>

<p>Roll out the remaining piece of paste.</p>

<p>Wet the edges of that in the basin, lay the cover on,
and trim round neatly.</p>

<p>Tie over a well-scalded and floured cloth, and boil for
four hours.</p>

<p>Oysters are sometimes put in these puddings; they
should be bearded, and the hard white part removed.</p>

<p>A rabbit or veal pudding may be made in the same
manner. To these add a quarter of a pound of lean ham
or bacon.</p>

<p>Where economy must be studied, less suet may be used
in making the crust.</p>

<li>A little flavouring essence.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Soak the gelatine in a little milk.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188">188</a></span>
Break the sponge cakes and ratafias, and put them into
a basin.</p>

<p>Boil the milk with the sugar.</p>

<p>Beat the eggs, and pour the milk on them.</p>

<p>Strain it into a jug, and put it to stand in a saucepan
of boiling water, and stir until the custard coats the spoon.</p>

<p>Then melt the gelatine, add it to the custard, and pour
it at once over the cakes.</p>

<p>While the mixture cools, pour a little jelly, coloured
with cochineal, into a plain round tin.</p>

<p>When it is set, place a jam-pot, or a smaller tin, on it,
and pour some jelly round the sides.</p>

<p>When it is quite firm, pour some boiling water into the
jam-pot, or tin, and remove it quickly.</p>

<p>When the custard and cakes are cold, but not set, add
the essence, and pour into the mould.</p>

<p>When quite firm, dip the tin in hot water for a second
or two, and turn it on to a glass dish.</p>

<h2><a name="vegetables">VEGETABLES.</a></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> rules for cooking vegetables are very simple, and
easily remembered. All vegetables, with the exception
of old potatoes, are put into boiling water. Green vegetables
must be boiled with the lid off the saucepan, as the
steam would discolour them, and the water must <i>boil</i>, <i>not
simmer</i>. Salt is added, in the proportion of one tablespoonful
to every two quarts of water. If the water is
very hard, it may be necessary to add a little piece of soda.
The lime in hard water discolours green vegetables, and
the use of soda is to throw this down. Do not, however,
use soda, unless obliged, as too much of it will destroy, to
some extent, the flavour of the vegetables. Peas must be
boiled gently, as rapid boiling would break their skins.
Haricot beans must be boiled gently, for the same reason.
Root vegetables take longer to cook than fresh ones. Old
potatoes must be put into warm water, as they require
gradual cooking, and must be boiled gently, until tender.
With that exception, all the others must be put into boiling
water. Carrots, turnips, and parsnips are generally cooked
with the meat with which they are served, as their flavour
is thereby improved.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>To Boil Potatoes.</h3>

<p>If boiled in their skins, scrub them perfectly clean, and
put them into a saucepan with sufficient warm water to
cover them.</p>

<p>Sprinkle them with salt and boil them gently for half
an hour or more, until very <i>nearly</i> tender, but not quite.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191">191</a></span>
Then pour the water away.</p>

<p>Peel the potatoes, replace them in the saucepan, sprinkle
salt upon them, cover them with a cloth, and put the lid
on the saucepan.</p>

<p>Let them stand by the side of the fire to finish cooking
in their own steam.</p>

<p>Care must be taken that the potatoes cooked in this
way are free from disease. One tainted potato would
destroy the flavour of the others.</p>

<p>If cooked without their skins, pare them thinly and
treat them in the same manner, pouring off the water when
they are very nearly tender, and finish cooking them in
their own steam.</p>

<p>If the potatoes are good and are cooked according to
these directions, they will be perfectly dry and flowery.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>To Steam Potatoes.</h3>

<p>Put the potatoes into the steamer, and sprinkle them
with salt.</p>

<p>Keep the water in the saucepan underneath quickly
boiling the whole time the potatoes are cooking.</p>

<p>If the potatoes are cooked in their skins,<a name="FNanchor_A_2" href="#Footnote_A_2" class="fnanchor">[*]</a> peel them
when very nearly tender, and put them back in the steamer
to finish cooking.</p>

<p>Steaming is one of the simplest and best ways of cooking
potatoes. If the potatoes are good and the water is kept
briskly boiling, this method cannot fail to be successful.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>To Cook New Potatoes.</h3>

<p>Put the potatoes into boiling water with some salt, and
boil gently for twenty minutes or more, according to their
age.</p>

<p>When very nearly tender pour off the water, cover them
with a cloth, and set the saucepan by the side of the fire,
and finish cooking in their own steam.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192">192</a></span></p>
<h3>Baked Potatoes.</h3>

<p>Choose nice potatoes, not too large, and scrub them
perfectly clean.</p>

<p>Bake them in a moderate oven for about an hour.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Brussels Sprouts.</h3>

<p>Trim them nicely and put them in boiling water, adding
salt in the proportion of a tablespoonful to every two quarts
of water.</p>

<p>Put in a little sugar, or, if the water is hard, a little
piece of soda the size of a pea.</p>

<p>Boil them quickly, with the lid off the saucepan, from
ten to twenty minutes, according to the size and age of the
sprouts.</p>

<p>When tender, drain them quite dry in a colander.</p>

<p>Dry the saucepan and put them back with a little
butter, pepper, and salt.</p>

<p>Shake them over the fire for a minute or so, and then
serve on a hot dish.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>To Boil a Cauliflower.</h3>

<p>Soak it in salt and water to draw out any insects, and
trim off the outside leaves.</p>

<p>Put it, with the flower downwards, into a saucepan of
boiling water with salt in it, and cook from twenty to thirty
minutes, according to its age.</p>

<p>Drain it on a sieve or colander.</p>

<p>If liked, it may be served with <a href="#plain_white_sauce">white</a> or <a href="#french_sauce">French sauce</a>
poured over it (<i>see</i> Sauces.)</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Green Peas.</h3>

<p>Put them into plenty of boiling water, with a little
sugar and a sprig or two of mint.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193">193</a></span>
Boil gently with the lid off the saucepan for twenty
minutes or more, according to their size and age.</p>

<p>Drain them in a colander.</p>

<p>Then put them into a saucepan with a little piece of
butter, a teaspoonful of castor sugar, pepper and salt,
and shake them over the fire for a minute or two.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>French Beans.</h3>

<p>Remove the strings and cut the beans into slices.</p>

<p>Put them into plenty of boiling water, with salt in the
proportion of one tablespoonful to every two quarts of
water, a little sugar, or, if the water is hard, a small piece
of soda about the size of a pea.</p>

<p>Boil quickly for fifteen minutes or longer, according to
their age.</p>

<p>Drain in a colander.</p>

<p>Then put them into a saucepan with a small piece of
butter, pepper and salt, and shake them over the fire for a
minute or two.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Spinach.</h3>

<p>Pull off the stalks and wash the spinach well in several
waters to remove all grit.</p>

<p>Put it into a saucepan without any water but that which
adheres to the leaves, and sprinkle a little salt over it.</p>

<p>Cook with the lid off the saucepan until quite tender,
stirring it occasionally.</p>

<p>Drain it in a colander, and wring it dry in a cloth.</p>

<p>Then chop it, or rub it through a wire sieve. The latter
method is preferable.</p>

<p>To dress it, mix it in a saucepan over the fire with a
little butter, pepper, and salt; a little cream may be used
also, care being taken not to make the spinach too moist
to serve.</p>

<p>Press it into shape, as a mound or pyramid, in a vegetable
dish, and garnish with fried <i>croutons</i> of bread.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194">194</a></span></p>
<h3>Asparagus.</h3>

<p>Cut the asparagus all the same length, and scrape the
white part lightly.</p>

<p>Tie it together and put it in boiling water, to which salt
has been added, in the proportion of one tablespoonful to
two quarts of water.</p>

<p>Add also half an ounce of butter.</p>

<p>Boil gently with the lid off the saucepan for half an
hour, until the green part is tender&mdash;very young asparagus
will not take so long.</p>

<p>Dish on toast; if liked, French or white sauce may be
poured over the green ends.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Jerusalem Artichokes.</h3>

<p>Peel them, and throw them into boiling water, with
salt in the proportion of one tablespoonful to every two
quarts of water.</p>

<p>Boil gently with the lid on the saucepan for about
fifteen or twenty minutes, until quite tender.</p>

<p>They may be served plain, or with French or white
sauce poured over them.</p>

<p>They should be sent to table quickly, or they will be
discoloured.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Carrots.</h3>

<p>Scrape them and put them into boiling water with salt
in it, in the proportion of one tablespoonful to every two
quarts of water.</p>

<p>Boil gently with the lid on the saucepan until they
are quite tender.</p>

<p>New carrots will take about twenty minutes, old ones an
hour or more, according to their age and size.</p>

<p>When they are served with boiled meat, they are
generally cooked with it. New carrots are sometimes
boiled in second stock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195">195</a></span>
When tender, they are put on a hot vegetable dish, the
stock is rapidly boiled down to a glaze, and poured over
them.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Turnips.</h3>

<p>Boil according to directions given for cooking carrots.
Turnips generally take about half an hour; but the time
depends on their age and size. If liked, they may be
rubbed through a wire sieve, and mashed with butter,
pepper, and salt.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Parsnips.</h3>

<p>Cook like carrots. They may be served plain, or rubbed
through a wire sieve and mashed with butter, pepper, and
salt.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Haricot Beans.</h3>

<p>Soak them overnight.</p>

<p>Put them into boiling water with a small piece of butter
and a small onion.</p>

<p>Boil gently from three to four hours until quite tender.</p>

<p>Drain them, and before serving shake them over the
fire with a little butter, pepper, and salt.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Spanish Onions.</h3>

<p>First blanch them by putting them into cold water and
bringing it to the boil.</p>

<p>Then throw away the water.</p>

<p>Rinse the onions, sprinkle some salt over them, and
put them into fresh water.</p>

<p>Boil gently from two to three hours, until perfectly
tender.</p>

<p>Drain them, and serve, if liked, with French, Italian
or white sauce.</p>

<p>Spanish onions are sometimes boiled in stock, or milk
which is afterwards used to make the sauce.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196">196</a></span></p>
<h3>Celery.</h3>

<p>Clean the celery thoroughly, and tie it in bundles.</p>

<p>Put it in boiling water, milk, or stock, with a little salt
and butter, and simmer gently for twenty minutes or more,
until quite tender.</p>

<p>Dish on a piece of toast.</p>

<p>If liked, a sauce may be made with the liquor in which
the celery has been cooked, and poured over it.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Vegetable Marrows.</h3>

<p>Peel the marrows thinly, and cut them in quarters,
removing the seeds.</p>

<p>Put them in boiling water, with salt in the proportion
of one tablespoonful to every two quarts of water, and boil
gently until tender.</p>

<p>They may be served, if desired, with French or white
sauce poured over them.</p>

<p>Marrows are very nice when boiled in milk; the milk
can afterwards be used to make the sauce.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Cabbage.</h3>

<p>Take off the outer decayed leaves, and soak the cabbage
in salt and water, to draw out any insects. If very large,
cut into quarters.</p>

<p>Put into boiling water, to which salt should be added,
in the proportion of a tablespoonful to every two quarts of
water. If the water is hard, a piece of soda the size of a
bean should be added.</p>

<p>Boil quickly&mdash;with the lid off the saucepan&mdash;for half
an hour, or more, until tender.</p>

<p>Drain well in a colander before serving.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197">197</a></span></p>
<h3>Broad Beans.</h3>

<p>Put them, when shelled, into boiling water, to which
salt should be added in the proportion of a tablespoonful
to every two quarts of water.</p>

<p>Boil gently, from fifteen minutes to half an hour,
according to their size and age.</p>

<p>When tender, pour the water away, and shake them in
the saucepan over the fire, with a little butter or dripping,
pepper, and salt.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Tomatoes.</h3>

<p>These are better baked than boiled: boiling destroys
their flavour.</p>

<p>Put them on a baking-tin, greased with butter or dripping.</p>

<p>Sprinkle over them a little pepper and salt, and cover
them with a greased paper.</p>

<p>Put them in a moderate oven, for about ten minutes or
a quarter of an hour.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Seakale.</h3>

<p>Tie it in bundles, and put into boiling water, with
a little butter, and also some salt, in the proportion of a
tablespoonful to every two quarts of water.</p>

<p>Boil, with the lid off the saucepan, until the seakale
is tender.</p>

<p>Drain, and serve on toast. French or white sauce
may be poured over it.</p>

<p>Seakale is sometimes boiled in milk, which should
afterwards be used to make the sauce.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Mushrooms.</h3>

<p>Peel the mushrooms; rinse them to remove any grit,
and cut off the ends of the stalks.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198">198</a></span>
Put them on a greased baking-tin, with the stalks upwards,
and put some little bits of butter on each mushroom,
with a little pepper and salt.</p>

<p>Cover them with buttered paper, and bake them in a
moderate oven from ten to twenty minutes, until tender.</p>

<p>Serve on a hot dish, with the gravy poured over them.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Stewed Mushrooms.</h3>

<p>Peel and rinse the mushrooms, and cut off the ends of
the stalks.</p>

<p>Stew them gently in water, stock, or milk, until quite
tender, adding pepper and salt to taste.</p>

<p>Then thicken the gravy with a little flour, and let it
cook well, stirring carefully.</p>

<p>Before serving, stir in a little cream or butter.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Fried Potatoes.</h3>

<p>Take thin peelings of potatoes, and twist into fancy
shapes, or cut the potatoes into thin slices.</p>

<p>Dry them well in a cloth, and drop them into hot fat
(<i>see</i> <a href="#french_frying">French Frying</a>) until quite crisp, and of a light brown
colour.</p>

<p>Remove them with a fish-slice or colander-spoon, and
drain them on kitchen paper.</p>

<h2><a name="soups">SOUPS.</a></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">These</span> are very valuable preparations, and are useful to the
poor as well as to the rich, as many of the most nutritious
soups are the cheapest. Pea soup, haricot soup, and lentil
soup are all rich in nourishment, and may be made at a
trifling cost, stock not being <i>necessary</i> for their manufacture.
The boilings from meat, when not too salt, may be
used with advantage in making these soups; but if this is
not available, they may be made quite well with water;
and, if carefully prepared, will have all the flavour of a
meat soup.</p>

<p>In making stock for meat soups, it must be borne in
mind that in order to extract the juices from the meat it
must be put into <i>cold</i> water, which should be heated very
gradually, and only allowed to <i>simmer</i>. In this way a rich
stock is procured, as all the virtue of the meat is drawn
into the water. Boiling would produce a poor and flavourless
stock, as the extreme heat applied, by hardening the
albumen, would tend to keep in the juices of the meat
instead of drawing them out.</p>

<p>In making stock from bones, the method to be pursued
is quite the opposite. Bones must be boiled, otherwise the
gelatine in them will not be extracted; simmering would
be of little use. The gelatine can only be thoroughly extracted
when they are boiled at higher pressure than is
possible in ordinary cookery. Bones contain so much gelatine
that after they have been once used in stock they should
be broken up in pieces and again boiled, so that the gelatine
from the <i>inside</i> may also be extracted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204">204</a></span>
An economical cook will often make excellent stock for
soup from bones alone, with the addition of suitable vegetables
for flavouring.</p>

<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;4&nbsp;lb. of shin of beef, or 2&nbsp;lb. of shin of beef and 2&nbsp;lb. of knuckle of veal.</li>
<li>5 pints of water.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>1 onion.</li>
<li>The white part of a leek.</li>
<li>1 dozen peppercorns.</li>
<li>1 sprig of parsley, thyme, and marjoram.</li>
<li>A bay leaf.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Cut the meat into pieces about one inch in size.</p>

<p>Break up the bone and remove the marrow.</p>

<p>Put bones and meat into a stockpot with the cold water.</p>

<p>Let them soak for half an hour.</p>

<p>Then put the pot on the fire; add some salt and pepper
to it, and gently simmer the contents for half an hour.</p>

<p>Next put in the vegetables sliced, and the herbs tied
together.</p>

<p>Simmer for 4½ hours longer, skimming occasionally.</p>

<p>Strain into a clean pan, and set aside to get cold.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>White Stock.</h3>

<p>This may be made by the directions in the preceding
recipe, using white meat instead of beef; knuckle of veal
is considered the stock meat for white soup. Knuckle of
veal and a rabbit make excellent stock.</p>

<p>Very good economical white stock may be made by using
bones only in making the stock, and no meat; use a ham-bone,
if possible, with the others, as this gives a nice flavour.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205">205</a></span></p>
<h3>Second Stock.</h3>

<p>Take any scraps of cooked or uncooked meat; any bones,
cooked or uncooked, to make second stock. Allow one pint
of water to every pound of meat and bones, and vegetables
in the same proportion as for first stock. The bones should
be broken up. Boil gently until all the virtue is extracted
from the meat, bones, and vegetables. The contents of
the stockpot should be emptied into a pan every night, and
the stock strained from the meat, bones, and vegetables.
These should be looked over, and the bones, meat, &amp;c.,
which are of no further use removed; the remainder should
be set aside to use with fresh stock material. Bones may
be boiled for a very long time before the gelatine will be
perfectly extracted.</p>

<p>Second stock, when cold, should be a stiff jelly, in consequence
of the gelatine contained in the bones.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>White Stock from Bones uncooked.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;4&nbsp;lb. of uncooked bones, with a ham-bone, if possible, amongst them.</li>
<li>5 pints of water.</li>
<li>2 carrots.</li>
<li>2 turnips.</li>
<li>1 large onion.</li>
<li>Half a head of celery.</li>
<li>1 sprig of parsley.</li>
<li>Thyme, marjoram, and a bay leaf.</li>
<li>1 blade of mace.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Break up the bones and put them with the
vegetables, sliced, into a stockpot with the water; boil
gently for five hours, adding pepper and salt to taste. Then
strain into a clean pan.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206">206</a></span></p>
<h3>Clear Soup.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;2 quarts of first stock.</li>
<li>¾&nbsp;lb. of gravy beef.</li>
<li>The white and shell of one egg.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Remove <i>all</i> the fat from the stock. If it is in
a jelly, take off as much as possible with an iron spoon, and
remove the remainder by washing the top of the stock with
a cloth dipped in very hot water.</p>

<p>Scrape the beef finely and soak it in two tablespoonfuls
of cold water to loosen the juices.</p>

<p>Put the stock in a stewpan and add the beef to it, the
white and shell of the egg, and a very tiny piece of each
kind of vegetable used in making the stock.</p>

<p>Whisk over the fire until the stock begins to simmer.</p>

<p>Then leave off stirring and let it well boil up.</p>

<p>Remove it from the fire and put it on one side for a
crust to form.</p>

<p>Tie a clean cloth to the four legs of a chair turned upside
down.</p>

<p>Pour some boiling water through it into a basin, to
ensure it being perfectly clean.</p>

<p>Then put a clean basin underneath and pour all the
contents of the stewpan on to the cloth. The first time
the soup runs through it will be cloudy, because the filter
made by the beef and egg will not have settled at the
bottom of the cloth.</p>

<p>Take the soup away; put a clean basin under the cloth,
and pour the soup slowly through.</p>

<p>If this is carefully done the soup will be quite brilliant
the second time of straining, and will not require to go
through the cloth again.</p>

<h2><a name="bread_cakes">BREAD AND CAKES.</a></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">In</span> making bread be careful that the yeast is good;
otherwise the bread may be heavy. The German and
French yeast will do quite as well as the brewers', and are
generally more easily procured. The French yeast is the
closest and strongest, but, though less is required, bread
made with it will take longer to rise than that made with
German. The yeast may be tested by mixing it with a
little sugar; if it is good, it has the power of dissolving the
sugar to a syrup. Everything made with yeast should be
allowed a proper time to rise. A quartern loaf will generally
be ready to make up in about two hours after the
dough is set, but the time of rising will vary according to
circumstances&mdash;for example, in cold weather it may not
rise so quickly as in hot. For making bread, warm the
pan or tub the dough is to be mixed in, but do not make it
hot. Take care that the flour is dry, and free from lumps.
The water used must be warmed, but care must be taken
that it is neither too hot nor too cold. A certain amount
of warmth is necessary for the growth of the yeast, but too
great heat kills it. The water, therefore, should be lukewarm.
When the dough is mixed, sprinkle the top with a little
flour to prevent a crust forming; the pan should then be
covered with a cloth and placed on a chair in a warm
place, free from draught. It may be placed with advantage
before the oven or boiler, but should not be put directly in
front of a fire. When the dough is exposed to too great a
heat it gets moist and sticky, is very difficult to make
up, and is heavy when baked. When the dough has risen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227">227</a></span>sufficiently, it should be well kneaded, and then made up
into loaves. These loaves are then set on floured tins to
rise in a warm place for about twenty minutes before they
are baked. The oven should be very hot for the first
twenty minutes, and then very much moderated: a sharp
heat is necessary at first to throw up the bread; but the
rest of the time the heat applied should be moderate. The
same heat is required in baking cakes: a sharp heat at
first, to throw them up, and moderate afterwards, so that
they may get cooked through without the crust burning.
The sugar in cakes causes them to burn very quickly. It
is, therefore, a wise precaution to line the tin, even for a
plain cake, with foolscap paper.</p>

<p>Currants used in cakes should be well washed and
dried before they are used, and any stones removed from
them. Sultanas should be rubbed in flour, and the stalks
picked off. Raisins should be stoned, and cut in two or
three pieces.</p>

<p>To cream butter is to work it about in a basin with
the hand, or wooden spoon, until it is the consistency of
cream.</p>

<p>The cake tins should be kept in a dry place, and before
using should be well greased, especially at the bottom.</p>

<h2><a name="jellies_creams">JELLIES AND CREAMS.</a></h2>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3><a name="to_clear_jellies">To clear Jellies.</a></h3>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Take</span> a large saucepan, and see that it is perfectly clean.
Put into it all the ingredients for the jelly, and the whites
and shells of the eggs. The use of the whites of eggs is
to clear the jelly; the shells form a filter through which
to strain it. Whisk all together over a quick fire until
the jelly begins to simmer; then immediately leave off
stirring, and let it well boil up. The heat of the boiling
jelly hardens the egg, which rises to the surface in
the form of a thick scum, bringing all impurities with it.
If the stirring were continued during the boiling it would
prevent the scum rising properly, and the jelly would
not clear.</p>

<p>When the jelly has well boiled up, remove it from the
fire and let it stand for a few minutes till a crust is formed.</p>

<p>To strain it, a chair may be turned upside down, and a
cloth tied firmly to its four legs. Any cloth, which is
clean, and not too closely woven, will answer the purpose.
Put a basin under the cloth, and pour some boiling water
through it. This will make it hot, and ensure its being
perfectly clean. Change the basin for a clean dry one, and
pour the whole contents of the saucepan on to the cloth.
The first runnings of the jelly will be cloudy, because the
filter which the eggs make will not have settled in the
cloth. As soon as the jelly runs slowly, and looks clear,
put a clean basin under the cloth, and put the first runnings
through it again, very gently, that they may not
disturb the filter of egg-shells.</p>

<p>Strain the jelly in a warm place, out of draught. Two
eggs are considered sufficient to clarify a quart of jelly, but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244">244</a></span>if the eggs are small it is wise to take a third. If there is
not sufficient white of egg, the jelly will not clear.</p>

<p>The jelly should be allowed to get nearly cold before it
is put into the moulds. If it is put hot into metal moulds
it is likely to become cloudy.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>To make Creams.</h3>

<p>To make a good cream, it is essential that the cream
used should be double; that is, a thick cream that will
whip up to a stiff froth. Beat it well with a wire whisk
until it will stand on the end of it without dropping. This
must be done in a cool place, especially in summer time.
Cream is liable to curdle, and turn to butter, if beaten
in too warm a temperature. The gelatine must be added
last of all. It should be stirred in thoroughly, but
quickly; it must not be too hot, or too cold, but just lukewarm.
If too hot, it destroys the lightness of the cream;
if too cold, it does not mix thoroughly. Pour the cream
into a mould as soon as the gelatine is mixed with it, as it
begins to set directly. To turn a jelly or cream out of its
mould, take a basin of hot water, as hot as the hand can
bear, draw the mould quickly through it, letting the water
quite cover it for a second. Wipe off all the moisture immediately
with a dry cloth. Shake the tin gently, to be
sure the contents are free. Lay the dish on the open side
of the mould, quickly reverse it, and draw the mould carefully
away.</p>

them, and trim each one at the side, top, and bottom
neatly.</p>

<p>Then line the tin with them, placing them on the top
of the cherries, with the brown side next the tin; they
should be put close together, and the last should serve as a
wedge to keep the others in place.</p>

<h2><a name="soufflees_omelets">SOUFFLÉES AND OMELETS.</a></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">The</span> best cooks will sometimes fail in making soufflées,
as their manufacture requires the very greatest care and
attention. It is also necessary to be able to judge to a
nicety the time they will take to cook, because, to be eaten
in perfection, they should be served directly they are ready.
In making a soufflée, be very careful to take <i>exact</i> measure
of the different ingredients; a little too much flour, or
rather too little milk, may make a great difference in the
lightness of it. The flour should be the best Vienna.</p>

<p>Another point to be attended to is to whip up the whites
of the eggs as stiffly as possible, and to mix them with the
other ingredients very lightly. Bear in mind that the
object in beating the whites of eggs is to introduce air into
the soufflée; and it is the expansion of the air when the
soufflée is cooking which makes it light. If the whites are
mixed heavily with the other ingredients, the air which has
been whipped into them is beaten out again; and consequently
they fail to make the soufflée light. When the
soufflée is firm in the middle, it is sufficiently cooked, and
should be served with the greatest expedition, as it will
begin to sink rapidly. An omelet soufflée, left in the oven
two or three minutes over time, will be quite spoilt, and
become tough and leathery.</p>

<p>Steamed soufflées are turned out of the tins they are
cooked in, and served with a sauce poured round them.</p>

<p>Baked soufflées are served in the tins, which are slipped
into a hot metal or silver case, or a napkin is folded round
them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264">264</a></span>
Plain omelets are quickly made, and quickly spoiled.
Some practice is required to make the plain omelet to perfection,
as the art consists in folding the omelet just at the
right moment, before the eggs used in them are too much
set. The omelet should not be firm throughout, like a
pancake, but should be moist and succulent in the middle.
A very sharp fire is essential, and the omelet should not
take more than three minutes in the making.</p>

<h3>A Small Savoury Omelet.</h3>

<ul class="ingredients-list">
<li><i>Ingredients</i>&mdash;2 or 3 eggs.</li>
<li>1 dessertspoonful of finely-chopped parsley.</li>
<li>1&nbsp;oz. of butter.</li>
<li>Pepper and salt.</li>
</ul>

<p><i>Method.</i>&mdash;Break the eggs into a basin.</p>

<p>Add to them the parsley, pepper, and salt.</p>

<p>Melt the butter in a small omelet-pan.</p>

<p>Beat the eggs very lightly, and pour them into the pan.</p>

<p>Shake and stir the mixture vigorously until it begins
to set.</p>

<p>When some of the egg is set and the other still
liquid, tilt the pan, and draw the egg quickly to the one
side of it.</p>

<p>Leave it there to set for two or three seconds; then tilt
the pan again and fold the omelet, quickly drawing it to
the other side of the pan.</p>

<p>As soon as the outside is set, turn it on a hot dish and
serve immediately.</p>

<p>To make an omelet successfully, a <i>very</i> quick fire is
necessary; an omelet should not take more than three
minutes to cook.</p>

<p>Larger omelets are made by using more eggs and butter
and parsley in proportion.</p>

<p>Chopped cooked ham and kidney may be added to a
savoury omelet; also mushrooms and shalots. The latter
should be finely chopped, and fried in a little butter before
they are used. A cheese omelet is made by adding grated
Parmesan or other cheese to the mixture.</p>

<h2><a name="invalid">INVALID COOKERY.</a></h2>


<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Much</span> attention should be paid to this branch of cookery.
The recovery of many sick people depends, to a great extent,
on their being able to take a proper amount of nourishment.
This they will not be likely to do, unless the
food is well cooked, and nicely served.</p>

<p>Everything, for an invalid, should be dressed plainly,
and <i>well cooked</i>. Highly seasoned meat, rich gravies,
sauces, puddings, &amp;c., should be avoided. The digestive
organs are weakened by illness, and should not be unduly
taxed. All meals should be served punctually; carelessness
in this respect has often been the cause of great
exhaustion. A good nurse ought to watch her patients
carefully, and never allow their strength to sink for want
of nourishment at the right time.</p>

<p>It is not wise to prepare too large a quantity of anything
at one time; an invalid's appetite is generally very
variable.</p>

<p>All fat should be carefully removed from beef-tea and
broth before they are served. This can be best done when
they are cold.</p>

<p>Great care should be taken to make everything look as
tempting as possible. The tray-cloths used, glass, silver,
&amp;c., should be spotlessly clean, and bright-looking.</p>

<i>Method.</i>&mdash;Scrape the beef very finely, and remove the
fat.</p>

<p>Soak the beef in the water for about half an hour,
moving it occasionally with a fork.</p>

<p>When the juices of the meat are drawn into the water,
and it has become a deep-red colour, it is ready for use and
should be strained.</p>

<p>This tea is better made from rump or beef steak.</p>

<p>Do not make too much at one time. In hot weather
two ounces or a quarter of a pound of meat will be quite
sufficient.</p>

<p>Be careful that the meat is perfectly sweet and good.</p>

<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Scraps of Meat.</h3>

<p>If there are not sufficient to re-cook for a made dish of
any kind, put them into the stock-pot.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Fat, cooked or uncooked.</h3>

<p>This can be cut in pieces and rendered down (<i>see</i>
<a href="#rendering_down_fat">Rendering down Fat</a>). It can be used for frying, plain
pastry, and cakes.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Fat Skimmings from the Stock-pot.</h3>

<p>This is excellent to fry cutlets, &amp;c., in, and can be used
instead of butter.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Dripping.</h3>

<p>Clarify it and use it for frying, plain cakes, and pastry.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292">292</a></span></p>
<h3>Scraps of Cheese.</h3>

<p>Grate them, and use for Welsh rare-bit, macaroni cheese,
cheese sandwiches, <i>pâtés</i>, &amp;c.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Cold Vegetables.</h3>

<p>If any quantity, re-warm them, or make into French
salads. Any scraps can be put into the stock-pot.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Water in which Vegetables have been boiled.</h3>

<p>Use this, if possible, for vegetable soups, as it contains
to a great extent the valuable salts of the vegetables.</p>


<div class="new-h3">&nbsp;</div>
<h3>Boilings from Meats.</h3>

<p>These, if not too salt, can be used to make pea, lentil,
and other vegetable soups.</p>
